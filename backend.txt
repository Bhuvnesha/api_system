We are going to create a simple PHP API without using any framework.
We'll use plain PHP and MySQL for database.

Steps:

Create a database and a table for users.

Create a connection to the database.

Create APIs for:

Register (POST): to register a new user.

Login (POST): to log in a user and return a token (we'll use a simple token for demonstration, not JWT).

Dashboard (GET): to get user details (protected by token).

Profile (GET and PUT): to view and update user profile (protected by token).

Logout (POST): to invalidate the token.

We'll use a simple token-based authentication. We'll store the token in the database and check it for protected endpoints.

Note: This is a simple example and not for production without further security measures.

Let's assume we have a database named php_api and a table users

CREATE TABLE users (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
password VARCHAR(255),
token VARCHAR(255) NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

We'll create the following files:

config.php: for database connection.

register.php: for user registration.

login.php: for user login.

dashboard.php: for dashboard data.

profile.php: for getting and updating profile.

logout.php: for logging out.

We'll use JSON for input and output.
